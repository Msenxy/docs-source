# React Documentation

Welcome to the React documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with React and build amazing web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have them installed, you can create a new React application using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Components

React is all about components. A component is a reusable piece of code that represents a part of the user interface. Here is an example of a simple React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function HelloWorld() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}

export default HelloWorld
```

## State and Props

State and props are two important concepts in React. State is used to store data that can change over time, while props are used to pass data from one component to another.

## Conclusion

React is a powerful library for building user interfaces. With its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, it makes it easy to build complex and interactive web applications.
